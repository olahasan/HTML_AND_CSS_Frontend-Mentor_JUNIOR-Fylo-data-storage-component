## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned

In this project, I learned how to effectively use CSS custom properties for maintaining a consistent color scheme. I also practiced using Flexbox for creating a responsive layout and improved my understanding of responsive design with media queries.

```css
.big-box .container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
```

### Continued Development

In future projects, I plan to focus on improving accessibility by using more semantic HTML tags and adding ARIA labels where necessary. I also aim to further optimize my CSS by grouping similar styles together.
